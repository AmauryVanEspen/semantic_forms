semantic_forms
==============

Form generators leveraging semantic web standards (RDF(S), OWL, SPARQL , ...

This will be a building block for web application frameworks,
like Play! Framework, Ruby on Rails, Drupal, etc, but not SQL based.

These web application frameworks all provide tools to facilitate the creation of forms with storage in database, data validation, etc. We want this, but no SQL, SPARQL instead. And no business (domain) objects in Object Oriented language at the origin of design flow, but RDF and OWL vocabularies. More precisely, a form should be made up of RDF properties in the spirit of Fresnel (a Display Vocabulary for RDF).
