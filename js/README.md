JavaScript implementations

Some example of pure JavaScript implementations are:

Of course, SPARQL servers can spit JSON-LD, which can readily be used by many JS libraries.
An idea is to leverage on Angular.js to achieve automatic update of forms when the local JS model changes.

A JavaScript library usable for RDF (actually used by Stample project):
