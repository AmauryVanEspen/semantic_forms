N3 rules implementations
---

* the goal is to redo for (X)HTML or HTML5 forms with N3 rules like I did for Swing generator
	See http://svn.code.sf.net/p/deductions/code/html/GUI_generation.html ,
	http://svn.code.sf.net/p/deductions/code/html/GUIgenerator.html
	http://svn.code.sf.net/p/eulergui/code/trunk/eulergui/html/documentation.html#L6973 )

* the form abstract syntax could leverage on some of Fresnel vocab', but adding some specific properties like mandatory field.
