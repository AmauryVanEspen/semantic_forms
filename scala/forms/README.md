Scala implementations
---

I have begun a Scala HTML form generator;
the code is here; it leverages on Banana-RDF.
( could be translated in JavaScript by Scala.js )


Currently it generates an abstract form FA from a resource,
then from FA XHTML form via the XML DSL Scala.

The display looks like this: 
[example.form.foaf.html](http://htmlpreview.github.io/?https://github.com/jmvanel/semantic_forms/blob/master/scala/forms/example.form.foaf.html)
