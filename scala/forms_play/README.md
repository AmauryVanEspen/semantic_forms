Play! framework implementations
---

I'm going to play with a web application! around this small form generator.

With these elements to add one after the other:

- 1 a SPARQL 1.1 server available (BigData (R)).
- 2 user enters an URI and form view appears with the data from the SPARQL server
- 3. URIs in the form can be clicked to display another form with the data from the SPARQL server
- 4 entering new triplets, as in DataGUI or as in Ontowiki: http://aksw.org/source/edit
-. 5 introduce the RDF cache, creation of a new URI in its class as DomainApplication ..... etc etc ...

At one point it will be useful to also introduce in place of FA an RDF vocabulary for forms, perhaps reusing Fresnel;
