Scala implementation for HTML of other backends;
Play! framework application for generic semantic data manipulation


* Creating an instance of given Class : a form is displayed; create a new unique URI every time
* RDF Cache (Jena TDB) : retrieve URI, download and store URI only if corresponding graph is empty
* URI and blank nodes are clickable
* simple search
* I18N for labels and tooltips
* HTML < datalist > for class uris and starting URI's
* When there is no rdfs:domain for a property P, we infer that P applies to every class in this ontology (questionable, will be removed)
